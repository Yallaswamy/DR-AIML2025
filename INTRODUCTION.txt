Before taking any project we must consider data and business problems are been considered.

Data collection-->data understanding-->data visulasation-->data pre-processing-->model building-->model evaluation-->deploy

To evaluate the machine learing algorithm we must have

1)pandas
2)numpy
3)Matplatlibity
4)Sklearn

Types of data algorithms:
 
1)Supervised--> It refers to the independent and target features which are used to predict the future instances.

2)Unsupervised--> It refers the independent features are present but there are no labelled features which the independent features are grouped to get appropiate result.

Types of business problems:

Classification--> It estimates the supervised algorithms which will work on labelled results which are discrete(not numbers)

Regression--> It refers to the supervised algorithms which will work on labelled features which are continous(numbers) and changes may occur continously like predicting the temperature 
tomorrow.

Clustering-->It will group the independent targets of data sets to predict the instance.    

File handling in python:

x--create
w--write(it will create and write the content into file if file is not created)
if we use w mode the old content will be overridden with new content
a--append it is used to add the data to previous data without losing the data.
